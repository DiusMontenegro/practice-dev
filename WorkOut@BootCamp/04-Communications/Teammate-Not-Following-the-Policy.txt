Teammate Not Following the Policy
Mimi is new to the company. She is very excited to be involved in new projects and to learn from her teammates. She reads the company policy provided by HR, but she noticed that Matt, a tenured teammate is not following the policy. Matt always goes out during work hours in the afternoon and would return after 1-3 hours. Her Mimi got confused because she read in the policy that an employee is only allowed at most 30 minutes of break in the afternoon. She asked Matt where he was going and Matt told her he normally meets his friends. Matt also told Mimi that it's okay and he just needs to offset the missed hours in the evening. Their supervisor is working remotely and he is busy managing other employees.

 1. What is wrong with this situation?
 2. What should Mimi do?
 3. To whom and how should Mimi communicate this?

 // Answers:

 1. The problem lies in Matt, a tenured teammate, consistently violating company policy by exceeding the allotted afternoon break time. With the supervisor busy and not actively managing, there's a potential lack of immediate corrective action, creating a concerning work dynamic.

 2. Mimi should be honest and proactive. She needs to address the policy violation directly with Matt, avoiding judgment and expressing concerns about maintaining a policy-compliant team. Given the supervisor's busy schedule, Mimi should consider documenting the instances and presenting a brief summary respectfully, emphasizing the importance of policy adherence for the overall well-being of the team.

 3. Mimi should communicate directly with Matt, avoiding any judgements, expressing observations and concerns about the policy violation with kindness and empathy. To ensure the issue is addressed, she could document instances and present a respectful summary to the busy supervisor, highlighting the importance of maintaining policy adherence for the team's well-being. This approach ensures transparency, commitment to policies, and collaborative efforts to resolve the situation.
