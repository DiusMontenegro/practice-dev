Mental Health Concern

Steve woke up feeling very down. He does not have an appetite to eat breakfast nor he doesn't want to go to work. He feels there's no sense in going to work or even doing anything else. He just wants to sleep the whole day. He has been feeling this for the past 3 days. Steve tried to report for work and do the tasks assigned to him, but he seems to get things wrong. The quality of his work is not the same as it used to be.

 1. What do you think is happening here?

 2. If you were Steve's supervisor and you noticed the change in Steve's output after 3 days, what would you do?

 3. If you were Steve, how are you going to communicate this to your supervisor and teammates?


 // Answer:

 1. Steve's change in behavior and declining performance over the past 3 days suggests he may be facing mental health challenges, impacting his well-being and work quality.

 2. As Steve's Supervisor, I will initiate a private conversation expressing genuine concern for Steve's well-being, avoiding judgment, and focusing on understanding his perspective. I will be honest about the observed performance decline, take responsibility for any workplace-related stress, and reassure Steve of the team's commitment to support him. Offer flexibility and discuss potential solutions while maintaining a proactive and empathetic approach.

 3. As Steve, I will recognize the changes in my mood and performance, and proactively communicate with the supervisor about my mental health challenges affecting work. I will be honest about feelings and the impact on performance, taking ownership of any mistakes made during this period. Express commitment to the role, willingness to work on improvements, and suggest potential adjustments or support needed. I will also avoid self-judgment and seek professional help if necessary, fostering open communication with both the supervisor and teammates.
