Sickness of a Family Member

Your wife suddenly feels sick. She could not stand up due to a headache and dizziness. She needs to lie down and needs assistance when going to the bathroom or when eating. You have just finished a meeting and a task needs to be completed within the day.

 1. What would be your plan in this situation?
 2. What would you do if helping your wife means you won't be able to complete all the tasks for the day?
 3. How should you communicate this with your supervisor and with your teammates?


Answer:

 1. I will prioritize my wife's Health, Attend to my wife's immediate needs, ensuring she is comfortable and safe. I will immediately communicate with your supervisor about the family emergency, explaining the situation and expressing the need to attend to my wife's health. I will transparent about the estimated duration of your absence. If possible, I will delegate urgent tasks to a teammate or request assistance to ensure that critical work is covered during your absence. I will also notify my team about the family emergency.

 2. If Helping Your Wife Means Not Completing All Tasks within the day, I will still prioritize my wife's well-being, and understand that unforeseen circumstances may impact work plans. I will communicate promptly with my supervisor and teammates about the situation, and reassure them that I am committed to catching up on any missed work as soon as possible.
