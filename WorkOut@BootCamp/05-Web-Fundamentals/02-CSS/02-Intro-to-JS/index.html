                        can achieve with it, and what other technologies play
                        well with it.

                        <em>JavaScript</em> &nbsp;was initially created to "make
                        web pages alive".

                        The programs in this language are called
                        <em>scripts</em>. They can be written right in a web
                        page's HTML and run automatically as the page loads.

                        Scripts are provided and executed in plain text. They

                        In this aspect, JavaScript is very different from
                        another language called

                            When JavaScript was created, it initiallyhad one
                            other name: "LiveScript". But Java was very popular
                            at that time, so it was decided that positioning a
                            new language as a "younger brother" ofJava would
                            help.

                        <p class="description">
                            But as it evolved, JavaScript became a fuly
                            independent language with its own specification
                            called

                        Today, JavaScript can execute not only in the browser,
                        but also on the server, or actually on any device that
                        has a special program called

                            Engines are complicated but the basics are easy.
                        </p>
                        <ol class="description">
                            <li>
                                The engine (embedded if it's a browser) reads
                                ("parses") the script.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Then it converts ("compiles") the script to the
                                machine language.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                And then the machine code runs, pretty fast.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p class="description">
                            The engine applies optimizations at each step of the
                            process. It even watches the compiled script as it
                            runs,analyzes the data that flow through it, and
                            further optimizes the machine code based on that
                            knowledge.
